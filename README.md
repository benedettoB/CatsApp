This Cat app uses the public Cats API found here: https://api.thecatapi.com to populate a list of cats (img, and id)
-Uses OkHttp3 and GSON as well as coroutines

User can add cat to favorites list by tapping the heart button on the list and/or in the details view
-The users favorites are stored in a local room database

Click Load More button to pull more cats from cat API

Entire app is built with compose and hilt 

I'm using this app to test new kotlin/android features in jetpack 

This is not meant for production. It's only an example for me to reference and for others curious about what I can do (linkedin etc)
